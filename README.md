# Sirato Substrate Explorer

![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/web3labs/epirus-substrate) ![GitHub repo size](https://img.shields.io/github/repo-size/web3labs/epirus-substrate)

> We recently rebranded from Epirus to Sirato

Blockchain explorer for Substrate chains with a focus on the [contracts pallet](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/frame/contracts) and [ink!](https://ink.substrate.io/)

## Overview

The system presents two main components:

**1. [Explorer UI](explorer-ui/)**

The explorer UI provides a user-friendly application to interact with the Squid Ink GraphQL API.

**2. [Squid Ink](squid-ink/)**

The Squid transforms data from a [Squid Archive](https://docs.subsquid.io/archives/substrate/self-hosted), stores it and exposes a GraphQL API for the UI.

## Deployment

We are publishing docker images of every service needed to run the full system.

You can find examples of docker compose configurations in the [local-testnet](https://github.com/web3labs/epirus-substrate/tree/main/local-testnet) folder.
